## What I did
- tests
- new route
- tried to use map to get all invoices per company but map doesn't play nice with returning objects within array. Unless I did it wrong.
- destructured objects so they're not as long
- figured out how to return 404 when invalid code is passed to delete route
    - I was requesting RETURN from a SELECT query.
